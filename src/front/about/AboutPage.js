        <h5>What is Stocks4all?</h5>
        <p>
            Stocks4all is a website that provides investment suggestions to amateur investors in the equity market of
            the NYSE, completely free of cost to solve their dilemma. The website suggests buy/sell actions on various
            stocks classified into different categories based on their sector of business operations. The website
            provides an investor the convenience to track their favorite stocks by creating multiple watch lists and
            adding stocks of interest to these lists.
            The closest offline equivalent would be an entity that provides financial advices like fund Management
            Company, or a person who does the same job like a stock broker, fund manager. Of course we donâ€™t manage any
            funds as of now but we aim to show our investors plenty of options to manage their hard earned money wisely
            using their own discretion.
